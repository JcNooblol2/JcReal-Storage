Song Title: Darling Iâ€™m a Mess
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
This might be wrong, but he's all I know
He's all I know
Most times, I pretend that he's just a friend
He's just a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss

[Verse 2]
Your lips I'll miss 'cause they're all I know
I can't let you go
And I won't forget all that you said
It's engraved in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss
No, oh, a goodbye kiss

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll try to make our hearts beat in time
Even though your rhythm might not beat with mine

[Chorus]
But darling, I'm a mess without your love (Without your love)
Heaven knows I'm trying, I'm trying to get by (No, no, no, no, no)
But darling, I'm a mess without your love
All I need is one more goodbye kiss (One more goodbye)
