Song Title: Feels Like Loneliness
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot, and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me, I'm not ready for your love (Yeah)
I keep on the go, but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're beggin' me, "please"
But darling, it's not the way to get me, baby, no (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
I gave you everything, love

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Verse 2]
We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew
So baby, you pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love -ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same and I'm through

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
I gave you everything, love

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Bridge]
Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness (Sometimes)
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes (Na-na-na-na-na, no, no, no, no)
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
