Song Title: Safe and Sound
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light

I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window, darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside your door keeps raging on

Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone...
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Interlude]
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound...

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh-whoa-whoa, oooh, oooh oh
Oooh (uhmm), oooh (hmm)-whoa-whoa, oooh, oooh oh
