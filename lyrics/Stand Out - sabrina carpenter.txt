Song Title: Stand Out
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Don't sweat all the little things
Just keep your eye on the bigger things
'Cause if you look a little closer
You're gonna get a bigger picture
Your heart beats like a marching drum
It's telling you to keep on walking on
And you gotta find a little fire
Shine your light a little brighter

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I were meant to fly like rockets in the night

[Chorus]
Keep your head up
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out
Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out

[Refrain]
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out

[Verse 2]
Jump on to the roller coaster
Up-up, now we're getting closer
We can be the silver lining
For every treasure that is hiding
We're coming on like the speed of light, yeah
"Boom-boom", it's like dynamite
We're gonna start a revolution
Don't stop, keep movin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I were meant to fly like rockets in the night

[Chorus]
Keep your head up
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out
Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out

[Refrain]
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Stand out

[Bridge]
Be the voice
Be the cause
Be the change
Be yourself
That's the best you can be

[Interlude]
You and I were meant to fly like rockets in the night

[Chorus]
Keep your head up
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out
Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid
And if you're gonna make a mess, make it loud (Make it loud)
And if you're gonna take a stand, stand out
