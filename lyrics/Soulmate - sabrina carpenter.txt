Song Title: Soulmate
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro: Sabrina Carpenter]
Ah-ah, ooh
Ah-ah

[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
Usually, I would overthink
I would try to read into each inflection
I would lose sleep (Ooh)
Trying to upkeep (Ah-ah)
Everything you need
I get too invested

[Refrain: Sabrina Carpenter]
'Cause I'm afraid of a fake connection
Makes me wonder why
I'm still feeling your affection

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Perfectly unattached, we know we'll never last
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (La-la-la)
You see me, woo, I might put you through hell and back
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (Ah)

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Is it okay that I'll never say "I love you,"
In the way that your heart expected?
Moth to a flame, you only wanna stay
'Cause I don't feel the same
Hope I don't regret this (Ooh)

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Perfectly unattached, we know we'll never last (Ooh)
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (La-la-la)
You see me, woo, I might put you through hell and back (Oh)
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (Ah)

[Post-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Not my lover (Ah-ah)
Not my baby (Ooh)
Not my best friend (Ah-ah)
Not my safe place
I'm not your problem (Ah-ah)
Not your maybe (Ooh)
Lucky for you (Ah-ah) that you're not my soulmate

[Refrain: Sabrina Carpenter]
Afraid of a fake connection
Makes me wonder why
I'm still feeling your affection

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Perfectly unattached, we know we'll never last
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (La-la-la)
You see me, woo, I might put you through hell and back
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (Ah)

[Post-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Not my lover (Ah-ah)
Not my baby (Ooh)
Not my best friend (Ah-ah)
Not my safe place
I'm not your problem (Ah-ah)
Not your maybe (Ooh)
Lucky for you (Ah-ah) that you're not my soulmate

[Bridge: Steph Jones]
Ooh, there's no pressure baby
'Cause you're not the one
I know you know it's true
So let's just ride the feeling
'Til I'm all mature, and I'll be-

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Perfectly unattached, we know we'll never last
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (La-la-la)
You see me, woo, I might put you through hell and back
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate (Ah)

[Post-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Not my lover (Ah-ah)
Not my baby (Ooh)
Not my best friend (Ah-ah)
Not my safe place
I'm not your problem (Ah-ah)
Not your maybe (Ooh)
Lucky for you (Ah-ah) that you're not my soulmate

[Outro: Sabrina Carpenter]
Perfectly unattached, we know we'll never last
Lucky for you that you're not my soulmate
