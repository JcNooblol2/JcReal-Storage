Song Title: Up!
Artist: Bini

[Intro: Gwen & Akira]
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap

[Verse 1: Mikha, Mikha & Colet, JL, Gelo & Maloi]
Living life in black and white
Trying to find what is right
Can't feel my heart out here
I'm a little nervous and a little obsessed
Because I always aim for the heart
Maybe if I work harder than I do now
Maybe if I believe in the impossible
Maybe if I keep on dreaming that I'll get to you
It will finally come true

[Pre-Chorus: Jhoanna, Nate, Nate & JL, JL]
You're too precious to give up
Even if I'm under attack
'Di ka susukuan, ika'y ipaglalaban
Anumang hadlang at harang
Kaya natin 'yang daanan
We've come this far, will keep it up

[Chorus: All, Maloi & Colet, Akira & JL]
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap
Never give up, never give up
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap
Up, up, up, up

[Verse 2: Akira, Nate & Mikki]
Found in you a different view
Saw the colors, felt brand new
Now that I can feel my drive
Still a little nervous, but I won't be stressed
I am diving into this life

[Verse 3: Aiah & Gwen, Gelo]
I don't really know where to begin
A lotta craziness been happeninâ€™
Ever since I saw you, I was sure
That you're the only one I wanna get to
Maybe you don't wanna listen to me
I'll show it to ya', best believe
They will talk about the day
That you and I will be together
And everybody goes like "Woah!"

[Pre-Chorus: Sheena & Stacey, Mikki, Mikki & Akira, Akira]
You're too precious to give up
Even if I'm under attack
'Di ka susukuan, ika'y ipaglalaban
Anumang hadlang at harang
Kaya natin 'yang daanan
We've come this far, will keep it up

[Chorus: All, Sheena & Stacey, Akira & JL]
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap
Never give up, never give up
Fly high up, to the sky up
Abot hanggang ulap, lipad ng pangarap
Up, up, up, up

[Bridge: All]
Up, up, up, up (Oh)
Up, up, up, up (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Maloi & Colet, JL, Akira]
You're too precious to give up
Even if I'm under attack
'Di ka susukuan, ika'y ipaglalaban
Anumang hadlang at harang
Kaya natin 'yang daanan
We've come this far, will keep it up
