Song Title: A Nonsense Christmas
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
It's the holiday remix
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to "Has a Huge North Pole"
You said you like my stockings better on the floor
Boy, I've been a bad girl, I guess I'm gettin' coal, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho"
I don't want Santa's elves underneath this ol' tree
Here's a lil' carol I wrote, it's about you and me (Me)

[Chorus]
You're my wish list
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' deckin' all the halls
I'm talkin' spikin' eggnog
I'm talkin' opposite of small
I'm talkin' big snowballs
You got a new toy for me
I'm out here trimmin' the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho, ho"
And I don't want Santa's elves (Don't want) underneath this ol' tree (Tree)
Here's a lil' carol I wrote (Yeah), it's about you and me

[Chorus]
You're my wish list (Wish list)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (When we're kissin')
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens (No)
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. (Mrs., uh)
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm talkin' (Talkin'), I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Talkin')

[Bridge]
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I'm talkin' chestnuts (Talkin')
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'

[Outro]
Look at all those presents, that's a big sack
Boy, that package is too big to gift wrap
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
Oh
