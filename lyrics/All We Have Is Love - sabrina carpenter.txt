Song Title: All We Have Is Love
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)

[Verse 2]
We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When everyday is ecstasy
We won't let the stars-crossed change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me (next to me, next to me)

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)

[Interlude]
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love (na-ah)

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love

[Outro]
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love (na-ah)
