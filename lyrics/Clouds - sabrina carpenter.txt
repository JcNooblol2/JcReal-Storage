Song Title: Clouds
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1: Fin Argus]
I fell down, down, down
Into this dark and lonely hole
There was no one there to care about me anymore
And I needed a way
To climb and grab a hold
Of the edge, you were sitting there holding a rope

[Chorus: Fin Argus & Sabrina Carpenter]
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear
It won't be long now
It won't be long now

[Verse 2: Fin Argus]
When we get back on land
Well, I'll never get my chance
Be ready to live and it'll be ripped right out of my hands
And maybe someday
We'll take a little ride
We'll go up, up, up and everything will be just fine

[Chorus: Fin Argus & Sabrina Carpenter]
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear
It won't be long now
It won't be long now

[Bridge: Fin Argus]
If only
I had a little bit more time
If only
I had a little bit more time with you

[Chorus: Fin Argus & Sabrina Carpenter]
We could go up, up, up
And take that little ride
We'll sit there holding hands
And everything will be just right
And maybe someday
I'll see you again
We'll float up in the clouds
And we'll never see the end

And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear
It won't be long now
It won't be long now
