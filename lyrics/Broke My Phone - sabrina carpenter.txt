Song Title: Broke My Phone
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Lately, texts have been gettin' laxy
Watchin' you move just like a movie (Ah)
The more we're talkin', the more it's hurtin'
Couldn't wait to do it in person

[Pre-Chorus]
You're kinda set in your ways
You're kinda settin' me straight
If you've been havin' your fun
While I'm alone with the pain
You don't make it easy
You're just makin' it hard
And now your name is the reason
That I'm fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Last night was the last time
I watched all our videos
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

[Post-Chorus]
Broke my phone
(Tears ever broke my phone)
You broke my phone

[Verse 2]
Guess there ain't no way to fix it
Once my eyes started drippin'
The connection, it was slippin'
Heard your voice and I'm weak
If it's just about a body
I could have 'bout anybody
Love was never just a hobby for me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're kinda set in your ways
You're kinda settin' me straight
If you've been havin' your fun
While I'm alone with the pain
You don't make it easy
You're just makin' it hard
And now your name is the reason
That I'm fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Last night was the last time
I watched all our videos
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

[Post-Chorus]
Broke my phone
(Tears ever broke my phone)
You broke my phone

[Bridge]
Never miss a call from you again
No more reminiscin' anything
Never miss a call from you again
No more reminiscin' anything

[Chorus]
Last night was the last time (Time)
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

[Outro]
Broke my phone
You broke my phone
