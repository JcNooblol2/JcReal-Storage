Song Title: Silver Nights
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
(Baby, baby
Baby, baby)

[Verse 1]
You're the best present ever
Life's a snow globe when we're together
Like a Norman Rockwell picture
Baby, baby
It's crazy how

[Chorus 1]
We're walkin' around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bow
In your arms, shootin' stars
Are bouncin' off the snowflakes
Fallin' down and decoratin' all the tangled lights
There's nothin' like these silver nights with you!

(Baby Baby)
[Verse 2]
Streets are crowded, stores are busy
Sippin' cocoa, I'm just wishing
There'll be a mistletoe so you might kiss me

[Chorus 2]
Walkin' around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bow
In your arms, shootin' stars
Are bouncin' off the snowflakes
Fallin' down and decoratin' all the tangled lights
There's nothin' like these silver nights with you!

[Interlude]
Ooo-ooo-hoo-oo-oo
Ooo-ooo-hoo-oo-oo
Ooo-ooo-hoo-oo-oo
Ooo-ooo-hoo-oo-oo

Baby, baby (baby, baby)
(I love these silver nights)
Baby baby (baby, baby)
(I love these silver nights)
Baby baby (baby, baby)
(Silver nights)
Baby baby (baby, baby)
I love these silver nights

[Chorus 3]
Walkin' around this frozen town
I'm wrapped up like a bow
In your arms, shootin' stars
Are bouncin' off the snowflakes
Fallin' down and decoratin' all the tangled lights
There's nothin' like the silver nights
Nothin' like the silver nights
Nothin' like the silver nights with you!
