Song Title: How to Go to Confession
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Love me now and love me well
It's your love I crave to know
Before I stand here buried in this unforgiving snow
Love me good, oh, love me please
But I'm pleased to know you at all
Pull me out before I'm gone
But please don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Fall asleep, but not for long
Your dreams are in your hands
Handle them gracefully
But don't let them sift like sand

[Verse 3]
Sing of love and sing of none
Remember when you are through
I'll be here to sing along
My heart will be with you

[Verse 4]
Moments are fleeting
Each end is a greeting
To what lies ahead
So get up from your bed

[Verse 5]
Keep your eyes off the clock
Time's spent better with them locked in mine
Oh, I tell you that it's true
Every second is a treasure with you

[Verse 6]
Winds are mean and time is too
I can see them in my face
But winds have timely brought us close
Like pearls sewn into lace
He has great plans in mind for us for welfare, not for woe

[Outro]
Plans to give us futures
Full of goodness
Full of hope
