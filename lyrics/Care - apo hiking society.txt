Song Title: Care
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
I don't need socks
I don't need slippers
I don't need shirts
I don't need sneakers
I don't need anything really nice to wear
I just need care

[Verse 2]
Don't need to hear daily reminders
Or gourmet food to ease my hunger
My need is simple and I think it's fair
I just need care

[Chorus]
Care how I laugh
Care how I feel
Care how I'll miss your warm embraces
Care what I like
Care what I share
Care how I'll miss your smiling face

[Verse 3]
If I need one, I'd look for summer
If I need rain, I'll take a shower
What I need most is something you can share
I just need care

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Care how I laugh
Care how I feel
Care how I'll miss your warm embraces
Care what I like
Care what I sharе
Care how I'll miss your smiling face

[Verse 1]
I don't need socks
I don't need slippers
I don't need shirts
I don't need snеakers
I don't need anything really nice to wear
I just need care

[Outro]
I just need care
I just need care
I just need care
