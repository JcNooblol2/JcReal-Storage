Song Title: Good Problem To Have
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Everybody warns me but they don't know how you make me feel
They say I should be with someone who's going somewhere
But when I'm with you, I'm there for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody sees what we do
Nobody hears what you say
Nobody knows me like you
How could they?

[Chorus]
Everyone says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
'Cause you're a good, good problem to havе

[Post-Chorus]
A really good problem
Good, good, real good problеm
Good, good
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

[Verse 2]
Call me up at midnight, as usual, you're hanging on the edge
Baby, I love the view when I stand by you
Holding my breath as we're on the ledge

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the words on your lips
I love the way that you think
Your mind is like an abyss
Dark as ink

[Chorus]
Everyone says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

[Post-Chorus]
A really good problem
Good, good, real good problem
Good, good
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

[Chorus]
Everybody says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad (Oh, nah)
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
(Easy turning me on like that)
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

[Post-Chorus]
A really good problem
Good, good, real good problem
Good, good
'Cause you're a good-
You're a really good problem to have
