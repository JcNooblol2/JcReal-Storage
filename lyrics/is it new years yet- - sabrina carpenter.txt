Song Title: is it new years yet?
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of this holiday
Not good at bein' present anyway
The songs are catchy, but they're overplayed
My relatives always know what to say to piss me off

[Pre-Chorus]
Small talk in the kitchen
Dated, dumb traditions
Who sucks competition (Oh)
Call it pessimism
December is a prison
It just makes me miss him

[Chorus]
Is it New Year's yet?
I'm gettin' bored, so can we skip ahead?
I just wanna forget
That I'm at home with nobody to hold
I'm dreamin' 'bout silver and gold (Silver and gold)
That champagne buzz down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Someone, not you, kissin' me, oh yes
Nеw Year's, is it New Year's yеt?

[Verse 2]
Santa, Santa, boy, you're the worst
It's the 25th, I wish it was the 1st
Couples all around me, damn, it hurts
Wanna push 'em in the fireplace and watch 'em burn
Santa, Santa, why do you hate me?
I'm a gift, look how God made me
Never, never get what's on my list
Fruitcake just makes me sick (Ugh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Small talk in the kitchen
Dated, dumb traditions
Who sucks competition (Oh)
Call it pessimism
December is a prison
It just makes me miss him

[Chorus]
Is it New Year's yet?
I'm gettin' bored, so can we skip ahead?
I just wanna forget
That I'm at home with nobody to hold
I'm dreamin' 'bout silver and gold (Silver and gold)
That champagne buzz down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Someone, not you, kissin' me, oh yes
New Year's, is it New Year's yet?

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh
Is it New Year's yet?
