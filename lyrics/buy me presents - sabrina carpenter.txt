Song Title: buy me presents
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
If you were a wise man, baby, you would drop
Every other ho, ho, ho and put me on top
Up there on your tree, better treat me like a star
Spend your cookie dough, dough, dough, spend it on my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the jet, send the sleigh
It's a packed holiday, and I got options, babe (Ah)

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk
If you're not gonna race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled
Well, I know somebody who will (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Somebody who will, somebody who will, somеbody who will)
(Buy me presents, baby)

[Verse 2]
Hе's a little bit older (Like, super old)
Got a bit of a dad bod
From a city that's colder (Brrr)
But damn it, he's so hot
He knows when I'm sleepin' (Sleepin')
And he knows when I'm not
I haven't, like, seen him in a while
He's probably just busy at his workshop

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the jet (Fuck the jet), send the sleigh (Send the sleigh)
It's a packed holiday, and I got options, babe (No)

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk (Oh)
If you're not gonna (You're not gonna) race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled (So filled)
Well, I know somebody who will

[Post-Chorus]
(Somebody who will, somebody who will, somebody who will)
(Buy me presents, baby)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk (Drink me like a warm glass of milk)
If you're not gonna (Oh) race here from the
North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stockin' filled
Oh, I know somebody who will
