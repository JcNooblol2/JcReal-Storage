Song Title: Come to Me
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
It's been some time
Since you came around to say hello
And every time there's a chance to
You just come and go
You just smile, wave goodbye
I don't know why you deny that I'm here

[Verse 2]
How long must time pass before you'll say
You're letting go
If there's a chance that you want to
Could you let me know
Don't just smile, wave goodbye
Tell me now, I have to know while I'm here
And loving you

[Chorus]
Come to me and hold me tight
Let me feel your love tonight
Let me show you all the love I feel inside
There's so much that we can do
You got me and I got you
Come to me and I'll go right back to you

[Verse 3]
Why waste your time thinking of what love can do for you
When anytime that you'd want to, I am here for you
Keep that smile, wave goodbye
Tell me now, I want to know while I'm here
And loving you

[Chorus]
Come to me and hold me tight
Let me feel your love tonight
Let me show you all the love I feel inside
There's so much that we can do
You got me and I got you
Come to me and I'll go right back to you

[Outro]
Come to me and I'll go right back to you
Come to me and I'll go right back to you
Come to me and I'll go right back to you
