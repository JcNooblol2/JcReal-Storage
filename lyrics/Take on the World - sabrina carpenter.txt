Song Title: Take on the World
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
I've been waiting for a day like this to come
Struck like lightning
My heart's beating like a drum
On the edge of something wonderful
Face to face with changes
What's it all about?
Life is crazy, but I know I can work it out
'Cause I got you to live it with me

[Chorus: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
I feel alright, I'm gonna take on the world
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"
I got a ticket to the top of the sky
I'm coming up, I'm on the ride of my life
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"

[Post-Chorus: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world

[Verse 2: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
Puzzle pieces
Throw them up into the air
Taking chances
Moments happen everywhere
And I got you to live them with me

[Chorus: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
I feel alright, I'm gonna take on the world
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"
I got a ticket to the top of the sky
I'm coming up, I'm on the ride of my life
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"

[Post-Chorus: Rowan Blanchard &  Sabrina Carpenter]
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
Take on the world, take on the world

[Bridge: Rowan Blanchard]
Flying high, I won't look down
Let my fears fall to the ground

[Breakdown: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
I feel alright, I'm gonna take on the world
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn
I got a ticket to the top of the sky
I'm coming up, I'm on the ride of my life

[Chorus: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
I feel alright, I'm gonna take on the world (Take on the world)
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"
I got a ticket to the top of the sky (Top of the sky)
I'm coming up, I'm on the ride of my life
I'm singing, "oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"

[Post-Chorus: Rowan Blanchard & Sabrina Carpenter]
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
Take on the world, take on the world
Take on the world
