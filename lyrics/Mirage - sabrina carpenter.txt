Song Title: Mirage
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
They said, "You can't wear Giamba
Baby, you gotta pay"
Well then, we got a problem, problem
"And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone"

[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh

[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Verse 2]
And we just go through the motions
Yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talking
Believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen

[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram (Hologram)
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent (So innocent)
It's all part of the scene, oh

[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got?
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
And is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got? Ooh

[Chorus]
Or is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Is it just a mirage?
