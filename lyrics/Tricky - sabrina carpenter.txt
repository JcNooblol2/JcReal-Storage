Song Title: Tricky
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Chorus: Shoffy]
Oh, it's tricky 'cause I want her
But she's always with another
And I know I should probably let her go
But I know if I do, she'll be back at my door

[Verse 1: Shoffy]
She tricky, she tricky, she knows it, yeah
Her game lately ain't really fair
We're up and down like a rollercoaster
Try to end it but it's never over
What do you want from me?
I'm about to go crazy (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Shoffy]
Tiptoeing on a tightrope
A step away from a wrong note

[Chorus: Shoffy, Sabrina Carpenter, Both]
Oh, it's tricky 'cause I want her
But she's always with another
And I know I should probably let her go
But I know if I do, she'll be back at my door
Oh, it's tricky (Oh) 'cause I need her
But the grass is always greener
And I know I should probably let her go
But I know if I do, she'll be back at my door

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
He tricky, he tricky, he's hard to read
Nothing with him's ever concrete
Mmm, every time I think we got the time
Is it a sign that we keep missin' the signs?
Now you got me acting all crazy
Thinking that you're gonna wait for me

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Tiptoeing on a tightrope
A step away from a wrong note

[Chorus: Shoffy, Sabrina Carpenter, Both]
Oh, it's tricky 'cause I want her
But she's always with another
And I know I should probably let her go
But I know if I do, she'll be back at my door
Oh, it's tricky (Tricky), 'cause I need her ('Cause I need him)
But the grass is (But the grass is) always greener (Always greener)
And I know I should probably let her go (Oh)
But I know if I do, she'll be back at my door

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter & Shoffy, Shoffy]
I'm hooked on you
Oh, what to do?
I know that I am falling
I'm lost for words
It's so absurd
Our kind of situation
I'm hooked on you
Oh, what to do?
I know that I am falling
I'm lost for words
It's so absurd
Our kind of situation

[Chorus: Shoffy, Sabrina Carpenter, Both]
Oh, it's tricky (It's tricky) 'cause I want her (I want her)
But she's always (She's always) with another (With another)
And I know I should probably let her go (Let her go)
But I know if I do she’ll be back at my door
Oh, it's tricky (She tricky) 'cause I need her (I need her)
But the grass (The grass is) is always greener (Always greener)
And I know I should probably let her go (Let her go)
But I know if I do she'll be back at my door

[Outro: Shoffy]
She tricky
I need her
The grass is
Always greener, always greener, always greener
