Song Title: Beginner
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm not a beginner
'Cause I've been there before
Tell me why I should believe you
You've hurt me once before
You cry on my shoulder
Tell me there's no other
When I turn around
There's somebody else

[Verse 2]
You're telling me the same old story
You say it won't happen again
That's when I start to worry
Will you stay with me until the end?
You play on my senses
Break down my defences
Wanna hold you like there's nobody else

[Chorus]
You keep saying that you love me
Say you'll never leave me
But you go ahead breaking my heart
You hold me and you tease me
Girl, oh please, release me
From magic of your cheating heart

[Verse 3]
Baby, I'm not a beginner
I've loved and I've lost before
Love isn't always the answer
Guess I've learned to take score
'Cause when you cry on my shoulder
Tell me there's no other
I just hold you like there's nobody else

[Chorus]
You keep saying that you love me
Say you'll never leave me
But you go ahead
Breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
You hold me and you tease me
Girl, oh please, release me
From magic of your cheating heart
You say that you love me
Say you'll never leave me
But you go ahead
Breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
You hold me and you tease me
Girl, oh please, release me
From the magic of your cheating heart

[Outro]
Maybe I'm not a beginner
'Cause I've been there before
