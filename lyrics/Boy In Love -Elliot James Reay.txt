Never been easy to please, always been best on my own 
 I don't need her to be kind, I get my kicks all alone 
 I don't do walks on the beach, I don't get dressed up for shows 
 She got me good, I feel like a boy in love 
 My heart's been bruised like a peach, my soul's been set like a stone 
 But now when Sam Cooke sings, she got me whistlin' along 
 I didn't think I could care, but now I wait by the phone 
 She got me good, I feel like a boy in love 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 Mercy, please 
 Suddenly I'm crawlin' to her on my knees (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, mercy, please 
 Suddenly I need her like a harmony (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Because she talks and she walks like a woman 
 She makes me feel like a boy, when I shouldn't 
 Oh, she got me good, I feel like a boy in love 
 (Oh, love) 
 (You don't know what you're missing) 
 Well now, I'm eager to please, when my lady is home 
 I'll give her X, Y, Z, so I can call her my own 
 I used to act like a man, but what did I ever know? 
 She got me good, I feel like a boy in love 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 (Ha-ah) yeah (ha-ah) 
 (Ha-ah, ha-ah) 
 (One, two, three, four) 
 Mercy, please 
 Suddenly I'm crawlin' to her on my knees (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, mercy, please 
 Suddenly I need her like a harmony (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 She is the subject of all my desire 
 Until I found her, I was merely a liar 
 Oh, she got me good, I feel like a boy in love 
 Oh, she got me good, I feel like a boy in love
