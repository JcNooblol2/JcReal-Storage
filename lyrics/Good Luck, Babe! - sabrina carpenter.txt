Song Title: Good Luck, Babe!
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothin', but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feelin'
You could say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe
Good luck, babe
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
Good luck, babe
Well, good luck, babe
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'

[Verse 2]
I'm cliché and who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kinda love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a littlе air

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love somеone who calls me baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feelin'
You could say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid re—
Good luck, babe
Well, good luck, babe
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
Good luck, babe
Well, good luck, babe
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feelin', no

[Bridge]
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothin' more than his wife
And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standin' face to face with "I told you so"
Well, I hate to say it, but I told you so
I hate to say, I told you so

[Chorus]
(You can kiss a hundred boys in bars)
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You could say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe
Well, good luck, baby
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
Good luck, babe
Good luck, babe
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'

[Outro]
Have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
Have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
Have to stop the world just to stop the feelin'
