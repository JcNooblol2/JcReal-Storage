Song Title: Love Yourself
Artist: Bini

[Intro: Stacey]
Attention, c'mon, look at me
These are things you gotta see

[Verse 1: Gwen]
Hey, leave the numbers and measures
Love your shape, it's precious
Baby, I believe, never can beat
Us if we just be, what we gotta be, you'll see

[Pre-Chorus: Sheena, Jhoanna]
Oh no, don't you ever question that
Your worth is so much more and that's a fact
'Wag papatalo sa sinasabi ng iba
Humingang malalim, buong-loob sabihin

[Chorus: Maloi, Colet, All]
Tara na't ika'y makiisa
Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya
Buksan lang ang mga mata
Lo-lo-lo-love yourself
Basta't tibayan ang loob
Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na
Just lo-lo-love yourself

[Verse 2: Aiah]
C'mon, shake your body, confidently
And feel it move effortlessly
Be free to see the beauty of your body
Two, three, shout it out, say it with me

[Verse 3: Stacey, Mikha]
Stop comparin', wе celebratin'
The lifе we have with pride and honor, yeah we precious
More precious than the jewels you could ever find
You shine brighter, my love (Ang ganda, ganda mo)
Tall, short, thin, thicc, light, dark hair
Skin type, color, race, hey, we don't care (Ang ganda, ganda mo)
Can't be labeled, can't be boxed, we don't belong there
Gotta be empowered know we got flare

[Pre-Chorus: Colet, Maloi]
Oh no, don't you ever question that
Your worth is so much more and that's a fact
'Wag papatalo sa sinasabi ng iba
Humingang malalim, buong-loob sabihin

[Chorus: Jhoanna, Sheena, All]
Tara na't ika'y makiisa
Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya
Buksan lang ang mga mata
Lo-lo-lo-love yourself
Basta't tibayan ang loob
Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na
Just lo-lo-love yourself

[Bridge: Jhoanna, Colet, Maloi, Colet & Maloi]
Ohh-oh-oh, hindi ka nag-iisa
'Pag nangangamba
'Wag kang mag-alala
Ikaw ay mahalaga

[Instrumental / Dance Break]

[Breakdown]
Love yourself
Love yourself
Let's go

[Chorus: Aiah, Mikha, All]
Tara na't ika'y makiisa
Tignan mo, ang ganda mo kaya
Buksan lang ang mga mata
Lo-lo-lo-love yourself
Basta't tibayan ang loob
Hindi ka mapapataob, 'lika na
Just lo-lo-love yourself

[Outro: All, Gwen]
Let me hear you say, B-I-N-I
Love my body and myself
I am worthy, I am free
Don't care what you say, just wanna be me
Gain all the confidence then lose
Only what weighs you down
All they got are standards but we got no limits
Respect, embrace, accept and love
BINI! (Real magic)
Just lo-lo-love yourself
