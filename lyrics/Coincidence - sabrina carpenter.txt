Song Title: Coincidence
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
(One, two, a-one, two, three, woo)

[Verse 1]
The second I put my head on your chest
She knew, she's got a real sixth sense
Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice
And without her even bein' here, she's back in your life
Now she's in the same damn city on the same damn night

[Chorus]
And you've lost all your common sense
What a coincidence

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Last week, you didn't have any doubts
This week, you're holdin' space for her tongue in your mouth
Now shе's sendin' you some pictures wеarin' less and less
Tryna turn the past into the present tense, huh
Suckin' up to all of your mutual friends

[Chorus]
And you've lost all your common sense (You've lost all your common sense)
The way you told me the truth, minus seven percent (Uh, minus seven percent)
What a coincidence, uh

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
What a surprise, your phone just died
Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs
Palm Springs looks nice, but who's by your side?
Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew
Least that's what you said (That's what you said)

[Chorus]
What a coincidence
Oh  wow, you just broke up again
What a coincidence

[Outro]
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)
