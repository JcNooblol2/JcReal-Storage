Song Title: Dream Girl
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm, hm

[Verse]
Don't need a rocket to take you to outer space
Barely need a couple minutes 'til I can't be replaced
I'ma make you lose your faith, lose your mind, you'll be mine
I'ma make you lose your faith, lose your mind, you'll be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So close you could touch it
I'll have you wonderin'
If it means something to me

[Chorus]
I bet you never thought you'd meet (Meet)
Straight-outta-movie girl like me (Me)
It only happens in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl
Made up of all your fantasies (-Sies)
I'll make you think you're seeing things (Things)
It only happеns in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl

[Post-Chorus]
Keep mе in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it
Never sleeping again, you can fuck your melatonin
When you wake up in my bed, it's gonna look like heaven, heaven
Keep me in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it
Never sleeping again, you can fuck your melatonin
When you wake up in my bed, it's gonna look like heaven, heaven

[Pre-Chorus]
So close you could touch it
I'll have you wonderin'
If it means something to me

[Chorus]
I bet you never thought you'd meet (Meet)
Straight-outta-movie girl like me (Me)
It only happens in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl
Made up of all your fantasies (-Sies)
I'll make you think you're seeing things (Things)
It only happens in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl

[Post-Chorus]
Keep me in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it
Never sleeping again, you can fuck your melatonin
When you wake up in my bed, it's gonna look like heaven, heaven
Keep me in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it
Never sleeping again, you can fuck your melatonin
When you wake up in my bed, it's gonna look like heaven, heaven
