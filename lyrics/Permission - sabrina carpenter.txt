Song Title: Permission
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Feel you inching closer on the sofa, what you indicating?
You took off your jacket, now I think I'm hyperventilating
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want you to think that I got a dirty mind
I don't want you to know that you're on it all the time
Yeah, I know that you're hesitant, lemme clarify
For you

[Chorus]
You have my permission
To pull me under, stop the overthinking
Throw me on the table and forget the dishes
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission
To go all night without the intermission
Yeah, but I'm the show and, oh, you're a musician
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission

[Verse 2]
I don't want a tour around your housе, we're getting off thе topic
I just wanna feel your hands on me, so take 'em out your pockets
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you to think that I got a dirty mind
I don't want you to know that you're on it all the time
Yeah, I know that you're hesitant, lemme clarify
For you

[Chorus]
You have my permission
To pull me under, stop the overthinking
Throw me on the table and forget the dishes
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission
To go all night without the intermission
Yeah, but I'm the show and, oh, you're a musician
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission

[Outro]
You do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do
You have my permission
You have my permission
