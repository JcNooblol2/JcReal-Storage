Song Title: Out Loud
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
I think I got a thing for you
I'm in my favorite dress for you
I can feel your eyes go where your hands wanna be
I think you got a thing for me
Why-y deny the chemistry?
If you wanna leave with me then baby, don't leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Look what you do to me
All this push and pull is messing me up
Oh, you do me cruel, you're more than a friend to me
We both know the truth, but that's not enough

[Chorus]
I wanna hear you say it out loud, out loud, out loud
I wanna hear you say it right now, right now, right now
I just wanna love you out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
Yeah, I wanna love you out loud

[Verse 2]
I kinda like the mystery
Sometimes I think you're make-beliеve
How can you be evеrywhere but not next to me?
We said tomorrow yesterday
We got, we got no time to waste
You know what to say to take this back to my place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Look what you do to me
All this push and pull is messing me up
Oh, you do me cruel, you're more than a friend to me
We both know the truth, but that's not enough

[Chorus]
I wanna hear you say it out loud, out loud, out loud
I wanna hear you say it right now, right now, right now
I just wanna love you out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
Yeah, I wanna love you out loud

[Bridge: Katie Pearlman & Sabrina Carpenter]
Just wanna love you, I, just wanna love you
Just wanna love you, I
(Yeah, I wanna love you out loud)
Just wanna love you, I, just wanna love you
Just wanna love you, I

[Chorus]
I wanna hear you say it out loud, out loud, out loud
I wanna hear you say it right now, right now, right now
I just wanna love you out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
Yeah, I wanna love you out loud
