Song Title: Best Thing I Got
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
So what if I just wanna be
A little bit out of my mind?
I let you take my heart and I like it
So what if I happen to be
A little bit out of my mind?
I bet I'll steal your heart and you'll like it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't think it's any kind of secret
I feel you from a million miles away

[Chorus]
And your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got

[Verse 2]
I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it
And sometimes I can tell that I
I'm just a little out of time
I make you skip a beat and I know it

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't think it's any kind of secret
I think of you a billion times a day

[Chorus]
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got

[Bridge]
So don't feel lonely tonight
You know I'll never be hard to find
So don't go out of your mind (Out of your mind)
You know I'll never be too hard to find

[Breakdown]
I know sometimes it seems like I
I'm just a little bit behind
I get back on the beat and you know it

[Chorus]
Your love is the best thing that I got
And it's only just begun
But it's never gonna stop
It's the best thing
The best thing that I got

[Outro]
Your love is the best thing
And it's only just begun
It's the best thing
