Song Title: Bad at Breaking Up
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
“I don't want to ruin this”
Is a funny thing to say
When we haven't been together
For sixty-seven days

[Pre-Chorus]
And every conversation feels normal
That's the weirdest part
When we try to keep it informal
End up in the dark
All this logic I've been ignoring
To be in your arms
And the more that we do this
Won't make it any less hard

[Chorus]
Say you gotta leave, so would you kindly stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We don't go far enough
We're bad at breaking up

[Post-Chorus]
We'rе bad at breaking up

[Verse 2]
It's objectively too much now, but I still anticipatе
When we talk for hours and hours, past our expiration date
And every conversation feels normal
That's the weirdest part
When we try keeping it formal
You'll end up in the dark
All this logic I've been ignoring
To be in your arms
And the more that we do this
Don't make it any less hard

[Chorus]
Say you gotta leave, so would you kindly stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We don't go far enough
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We're bad at breaking up

[Bridge]
Keep me on a string, but I hold it so tight
And this toxicity gets to me just right
We're not done with this saga
This late night TV drama
And when it ends, I'll be a wreck
So let me have this for a sec

[Chorus]
Say you gotta leave, so would you kindly stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
Say you gotta leave, so why'd you kindly stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We're scared of losing us
We're bad at breaking up

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-yeah, ah-ah-yeah
Ah-ah-la-la, we're scared of losing us
Yeah, we're bad at breaking up
