Song Title: That’s Not How This Works (Sabrina's version)
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Thought the day you disappeared that it was over
Didn't even hear you leavin'
Saw you with someone and thought that it was closure
But you still tell me that you need me

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Baby, why, tell me, why
Can't you just make up your mind?
Quit messin' with my head

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, no

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
No, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
Baby, that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, oh

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Stop remindin' me of when we said "forever"
I know exactly what you're doin'
Oh, when you say you need to drop off all my sweaters
It's just one of your еxcuses

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Charlie Puth]
Baby, why, tell me, why
Can't you just makе up your mind?
Quit messin' with my head

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Charlie Puth]
You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no (That's not how this works)
That's not how this works, no (Not how this works)

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter & Dan + Shay, Charlie Puth]
Don't say that you're in love with me (Say that you're in love)
'Cause I know it's not what you mean

[Chorus: Dan + Shay, Sabrina Carpenter, Charlie Puth,  All]
You can't say you hate me
Then call me when you're hurt
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works (Works, baby, no)
You can't walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that's not how this works, no
That's not how this works, no (Oh, woah)

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Dan + Shay, Sabrina Carpenter, All]
No, no, no, no (Hey)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, that's not how this works, no (This works)
That's not how this works, oh (This works)

[Outro: Charlie Puth, All]
No, no, no, no (Ooh, oh, oh)
Oh, no, no, no, no
Baby, that's not how this works
