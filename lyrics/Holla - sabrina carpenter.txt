Song Title: Holla
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Tell me why at 8 o'clock you get so tired
You still sleepin', you still sleepin' when I'm out at night
You'll be better when you're older, like a good red wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh, you never call when you say so
Ohh, you never ask how my day goes
Ohh, and now's not the right time for the two of us
'Cause

[Chorus]
You got a little bit longer to go
And ooh, maybe I'll see you someday down the road
But you got a little bit less than what I need
When you're good and ready, holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' you got all the answers every time
Likе the world was just your birthday present, gеt in line
You'll be better when you're older, like The Starry Night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you never call when you say so
Ooh, you never ask how my day goes
Ohh, and now's not the right time for the two of us
'Cause

[Chorus]
You got a little bit longer to go
And ooh, maybe I'll see you someday down the road
But you got a little bit less than what I need
When you're good and ready, holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby

[Bridge]
You got a little bit longer, you do
You got a little bit something to prove
Call me the minute, the second you do
Holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me

[Chorus]
You got a little bit longer to go
And ooh, maybe I'll see you someday down the road
But you got a little bit less than what I need
When you're good and ready, holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby
Holla, holla at me, baby
