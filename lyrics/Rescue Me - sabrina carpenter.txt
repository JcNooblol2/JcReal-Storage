Song Title: Rescue Me
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh
Woah-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Whoa-oh, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me

[Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Whoa-whoa-whoa, darling, please rescue me
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Give your heart
Baby, just ease your mind
To see that it's meant to be
'Cause when I'm with you, darling, it's such a breeze
That I know, know you'll rescue me

[Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Whoa-whoa-whoa, darling, please rescue me
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?

[Bridge]
And honey, if you see me drowning
Baby, fish me out, I'm falling
I just need a voice for calling
And can't you see I trust you always?
So I will linger 'til you know
That I will never let you go if you rescue me

[Outro]
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Whoa-oh, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me
