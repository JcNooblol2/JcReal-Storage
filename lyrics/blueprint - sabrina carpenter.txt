Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
(Ooh, did I?)
(Ooh, did I?)
(Ooh, did I?)
(Ooh, did I?)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
You can see me for a night now
If you're lucky, 'til it's light out
But maybe one day if you play the cards right
You could see me in a white gown (White gown)
If you wanna build a life with me (Life with me)
Ya better keep it right with me (Right with me)
I know you wanna stay for another couple days
I can change your flight right now (Let's go)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, your mind is designed
To be flying when I touch it (When I touch it)
Oh, your heart only starts (Only starts)
When I'm hoverin' above it (It, it, it, go!)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the blueprint for everything you like
I'm the perfect prototype, I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh-ooh)
If you take my love and lose it
You won't find it twice
Lookin' for a lookalike
But they don't make 'em like me (Ooh-ooh)
Baby, I'm the blueprint (Did I?) for everything you like (Ooh, ooh)
We invented butterflies (Ooh, did I?)
I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh, ooh)
If you take my love and lose it (Ooh, did I?)
You won't find it twice (Ooh, did I?)
Lookin' for a lookalike (Ooh, did I?)
But they don't make 'em like me (Ooh, did I?)

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh, did I? Ooh, did I? Ooh, did I? Ooh, did I?, Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Everything you want, everything you need
Enough to make you question if you ever loved the ones you say you loved before me
Last time is to dust, can't even compete
I could make it oh, so easy

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the blueprint for everything you like
I'm the perfect prototype, I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh-ooh)
If you take my love and lose it
You won't find it twice
Lookin' for a lookalike
But they don't make 'em like me (Ooh-ooh)
Baby, I'm the blueprint (Did I?) for everything you like (Ooh, ooh)
We invented butterflies (Ooh, did I?)
I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh, ooh)
If you take my love and lose it (Ooh, did I?)
You won't find it twice (Ooh, did I?)
Lookin' for a lookalike (Ooh, did I?)
But they don't make 'em like me (Ooh, did I?)

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh, did I? Ooh, did I? Ooh, did I? Ooh, did I?, Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, your mind is designed
To be flying when I touch it (When I touch it)
Oh, your heart only starts (Only starts)
When I'm hoverin' above it (It, it, it, go!)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm the blueprint for everything you like
I'm the perfect prototype, I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh-ooh)
If you take my love and lose it, you won't find it twice
Lookin' for a lookalike
But they don't make 'em like me (Ooh-ooh)
Baby, I'm the blueprint (Did I?) for everything you like (Ooh-ooh)
We invented butterflies (Ooh, did I?)
I'm like nothin' you've seen (Ooh-ooh)
If you take my love and lose it (Ooh, did I?)
You won't find it twice (Ooh, did I?)
Lookin' for a lookalike (Ooh, did I?)
