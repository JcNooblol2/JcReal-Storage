Song Title: Here With You
Artist: Bini

[Verse 1: Mikha, Stacey, Jhoanna]
I saw the line of a thousand other dreams coming true
Nervous faces and heart races
Can I come through?
Used to dance on my own
Thought I was all alone
Then I found your new faces
Now I know where my place is

[Pre-Chorus: Stacey]
When the world was telling me, "No"
You pushed my heart to just go
And now for sure, I know

[Chorus: Colet, Maloi & Gwen, Maloi]
Now here with you, found something new
Through the dark nights, the highlights
You're my lifeline, as we take our flight
Let's paint the sky in different lights
Holding onto all that we could bе
Gonna make it bright

[Post-Chorus: All]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Sheena, Jhoanna & Colet, Gwen]
Opened our еyes, to the rain coming down on sunny days
Sacrifices, compromises
Do we like the view?
Would've want to quit the show
But with you, we've got a reason to keep going on this road
Now we know where our place is

[Pre-Chorus: Aiah]
When the world was telling me, "No"
You pushed my heart to just go
And now for sure, we know

[Chorus: All, Stacey, Colet & Gwen]
Now here with you, found something new (Now here with you)
Through the dark nights, the highlights (Woah, ooh, woah, ooh, oh, oh)
You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (You're my lifeline)
Let's paint the sky in different lights
Holding onto all that we could be
Gonna make it bright

[Bridge: Maloi, Gwen & Maloi]
And no matter what they say to break us, take our spirits down
We just need to look around

[Chorus: Aiah, Stacey, Colet & Sheena, Maloi, Jhoanna, Mikha, Maloi & Gwen, Colet]
Now here with you (Yeah, yeah)
Found something new (Found something new)
Through the dark nights, the highlights (Ooh, woah)
You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (Ooh, woah)
Let's paint the sky in different lights (Let's paint the sky, ooh)
Holding onto all that we could be (All that we could be)
Gonna make it bright

[Chorus: All, Jhoanna, Colet]
Now here with you (Oh, oh)
Found something new (Oh, oh)
Through the dark nights (Oh), the highlights (Hey)
You're my lifeline, as we take our flight (Take a flight)
Let's paint the sky in different lights (Ah-ah)
Holding onto all that we could be
Gonna make it bright (Gonna make it bright)

[Post-Chorus: All]
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
