Bini!

I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my way
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're here just here to have a good time (let's go)

I'm high in the clouds
That's a new level, what a good flight (oh-oh, oh-oh)
No trouble around, we don't stress no one
Just a good time (oh-oh, ooh-woah)

And I won't let you take me down
Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days
I will always hold my ground and stand up right
I'm putting on my game face

I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my away
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're here just here to have a good time

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

So don't mind the doubt
You can do whatever, as long as you try (oh-oh, oh-oh)
No matter if you're down, get up
'Cause it's alright (oh-oh, ooh-woah)

And I won't let you take me down
Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days
I will always hold my ground and stand up right
I'm putting on my game face

I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my away
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're here just here to have a good time

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
I'm showing no fear (go)
