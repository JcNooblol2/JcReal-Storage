[Intro: All]
BINI!

[Chorus: Maloi, Stacey, Mikha]
I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my way
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're just here to have a good time (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Gwen, Aiah]
I'm high in the clouds, that's a new level
What a good flight (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
No trouble around, we don't stress no one
Just a good time (Oh-oh, ooh-woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Mikha, Jhoanna]
And I won't let you take me down
Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days
I will always hold my ground and stand up right
I'm puttin' on my game face

[Chorus: Sheena, Colet]
I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my way
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're just here to have a good time

[Post-Chorus: Jhoanna, Colet, Maloi, Stacey]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

[Verse 2: Mikha & Jhoanna, Aiah & Sheena]
So don't mind the doubt
You can do whatever, as long as you try (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
No matter if you're down, get up
'Cause it's alright (Oh-oh, ooh-woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Colet, Maloi]
And I won't let you take me down
Or change my mind, I'm looking at better days
I will always hold my ground and stand up right
I'm putting on my game face

[Chorus: Stacey, Gwen]
I'm feeling like I can't lose
I won't let you get in my way
Over and over, I'll prove
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
We're just here to have a good time

[Post-Chorus: Colet, Sheena, Maloi, Aiah]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear

[Interlude: Gwen, Stacey]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm showing no fear

[Outro: All, Gwen, Jhoanna, Mikha]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
I'm showing no fear, I'm showing no fear
I'm showing no fear
