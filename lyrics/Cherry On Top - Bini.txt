Song Title: Cherry On Top
Artist: Bini

[Verse 1: Stacey & Colet]
My presence is a present (Ooh, ooh-yeah-yeah)
Talkin' French, I'll keep you guessin' (Ooh, ooh-là-là)
Know you got a little candy crush (Crush)
Be careful 'cause you'll never get enough (Enough)

[Pre-Chorus: Aiah & Mikha]
Every day
Celebrate you're with me
Every day
It's your birthday on repeat, birthday on repeat-eat, yeah

[Chorus: Jhoanna, Sheena, Maloi & Colet]
If you want it sweet, got that sugar on lock
If you want that spice, I can turn the heat up
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top
Honey, you're a bee, got you buzzin' 'round me
Sticky, sticky, sweet, frosty as I can be
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top

[Verse 2: Gwen, Maloi & Sheena]
Cherry, cherry, I'm so berry, rainbow, cotton candy
Glitzy glamour, drippin' drama, oh, I'm just so fancy (Ooh)
You can't deny, no-no, you can't deny (Uh, uh)
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top

[Verse 3: Mikha]
I'm a sight for sorry eyes
One look and you're paralyzed (Uh-huh)
Dancin' in the disco lights (Yeah, yeah)
I could do this all my life
Cinnamon swirl, I twirl (Twirl)
Not your average girl (Girl)
Got you clutchin' them pearls (Pearls)
'Cause you know who run the world

[Pre-Chorus: Aiah, Mikha & Stacey]
Every day (Every day)
Celebrate you're with me (You're with me, yeah)
Every day (Yeah)
It's your birthday on repeat, birthday on repeat-eat, yeah

[Chorus: Jhoanna, Sheena, Maloi & Colet]
If you want it sweet, got that sugar on lock
If you want that spice, I can turn the heat up
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top
Honey, you're a bee, got you buzzin' 'round me
Sticky, sticky, sweet, frosty as I can be (Uh-huh)
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top

[Bridge: Aiah & Stacey]

There's no going back, no, once you try

[Chorus: Jhoanna, Sheena, Maloi & Colet]
If you want it sweet, got that sugar on lock
If you want that spice, I can turn the heat up
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top
Honey, you're a bee, got you buzzin' 'round me
Sticky, sticky, sweet, frosty as I can be
Baby, I'm the cake, better know what you got
I'm the cherry on top, cherry on top
