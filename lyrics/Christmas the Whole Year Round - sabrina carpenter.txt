Song Title: Christmas the Whole Year Round
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Chorus]
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

[Verse 1]
I don't care if snow stops falling down
Santa's come and gone, yeah he's left town
I don't need a Christmas tree
Mistletoe, or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

[Verse 2]
All those pretty lights have been put away
And old Rudolph is gone on holiday
We'll keep that fire burning
Though the calendar is turning
Why stop at 1, hey we're full
When we can have 364 more

[Chorus]
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

[Verse 3]
I don't need a Christmas tree
Mistletoe or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year
Make Christmas the whole year
Let's make Christmas the whole year round
Let's make Christmas the whole year round
