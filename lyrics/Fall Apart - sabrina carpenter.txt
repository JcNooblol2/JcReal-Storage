Song Title: Fall Apart
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Standing in the dark with you
I thank my lucky stars
That all those movie scenes aren't just wishful thinking
If you believe that it can happen to you

[Verse 2]
I can feel your eyes on me, I've got no place to hide
If it were brighter you could see my cheeks turn red
Oh, it's so quiet I can hear my heartbeat in my head

[Chorus]
When he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

[Verse 3]
I don't have a role, right now I'm playing myself
There's no camera or director standing by
What do I do? I keep forgetting all my stupid lines!

[Chorus]
When he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

[Bridge]
Remember when Spider-Man kissed Mary Jane upside down in the rain?
She didn't need to know his name, she couldn't even see his face

[Chorus]
So when he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

[Chorus]
So when he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart
Just fall apart
And just fall apart
