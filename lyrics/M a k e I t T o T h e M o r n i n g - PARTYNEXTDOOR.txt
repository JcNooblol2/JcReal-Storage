[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight, but you got the wrong vibes
Hold in, let me get you right, it's how I apologize
JT when you act up, I'll eat the pussy up
And give you somethin' to make noise about
Don't scream or shout, I'm workin' my way down
Girl, you gettin' loud, now put it in yo' mouth
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The shit I did last night I'm not real proud of (Wet)
But let's just wait 'til the mornin' until I say my part, oh

[Chorus]
Let's make it to the mornin', girl, yeah
Let's make it, yeah, yеah
Oh, let's make it to the mornin', girl
Ooh-woah, oh, yеah

I don't wanna fight with ya (Don't wanna)
Try to end my night with ya (End my night wit' ya)
Don't let yo' mind getcha, I wanna vibe wit' you
Woah, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah, nah, nah), yeah
As soon as I get up out of this bed, I'm tryna make love (Oh yeah)
As soon as I get up out of this bed, I'm tryna make it up (Oh)
It's the lyin' you said, felt like make believe, you can't just make shit up (Oh)
It's the spinnin' and spinnin' again for me
My shawty gon' spin back again for me
Yeah, I know I say it all the time, but I promise
And let's just say it'll take a little more patience, ooh
'Cause the shit I did last night, I'm not real proud of
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's make it to the mornin', girl, yeah
Let's make it, yeah
Oh, let's make it to the mornin', girl
