Song Title: need u
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
I was strong for a moment
But you made me weak
Say you gave me something
When I had everything
When I'm with you
I find the piece
The piece that was missing
Before you and me, mmhm

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't got nothing to hide
I wear this love in my eyes
And my heart decided
That you're mine

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I think I need u, mmm
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”

[Verse 2]
Life comes at you fast
So I took your hand and you slammed on the gas
And I swear to God I'll never look back, back, back
Oh, I'll never look back

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause, baby, with you
I ain't got nothing to hide
I'll wear this love in my eyes
'Cause anywhere that we're going, yeah, I know it's gon' be paradise

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I think I need u, mmm
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”
