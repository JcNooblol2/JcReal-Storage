Song Title: off script
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Oh, what a pleasant surprise
Don't know how it ends but I'm here for the ride
Oh, do we have to define?
Or could we just find out some other time, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess that's just the story of us
It's bound to be ambiguous
I don't even care to be frustrated
All I'm saying is

[Chorus]
I'll go off script for your lo-lo-love
Take risks, but I don't mind
We're going off script for your lo-lo-love
Don't know where it's going
'Cause baby we're going off script

[Verse 2]
Save all of your good advice
Need to see what it's like to learn my wrongs from my rights
Even I can't predict my next move
I might change my mind out the blue
I know only one thing is true
Is that since I'm addicted to you

[Chorus]
I'm going off script for your lo-lo-love (Lo-lo-love)
Take risks, but I don't mind
We're going off script for your lo-lo-love
Don't know where it's going
'Cause baby we're going off script

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess that's just the story of us
It's bound to be ambiguous
I don't even care to be frustrated
All I'm saying is

[Chorus]
I'll go off script for your lo-lo-love (Lo-lo-love)
Take risks, but I don't mind
We're going off script for your lo-lo-love
Don't know where it's going
'Cause baby we're going off script
