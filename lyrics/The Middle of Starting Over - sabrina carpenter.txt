Song Title: The Middle of Starting Over
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Bridge]
The colors and the stars seem a little brighter (Oh-oh)
Tomorrow isn't far away (Not far away, oh-oh)
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Chance to do it over, get it right this time (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
