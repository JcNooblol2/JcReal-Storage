They say, you know when you know
So let's face it, you had me at hello
Hesitation never helps
How could this be anything anything else

When all I dream of is your eyes
All I long for is your touch
And darling something tells me that's enough mmm
You can say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much
But I think they call this love

One smile, one kiss, two lonely hearts is all that it takes
Now baby you're on my mind, every night, every day
Good vibrations getting loud
How could this be anything anything else

When all I dream of is your eyes
All I long for is your touch
And darling something tells me that's enough mmm
You can say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much
But I think they call this love
Oh I think they call this love

What could this be?
Between you and me
Oh

All I dream of is your eyes
All I long for is your touch
And darling something tells me tells me that's enough mmm
You could say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much
But I think they call
Oh I think they call
Yes I think they call
This Love
This Love
