Song Title: A New Thing in My Life
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
Here, I'm sitting on my piano
Wondering what to write today
I haven't had a melody all day
Here, I'm sitting on my piano
Wondering if it'll come at all
Sometimes you know, it don't come at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a deadline and my time is running short
I need an inspiration to come to me
And show me where to go

[Chorus]
I need a new thing in my life
To get me through
All the ups and downs
Turn me around
A new thing in my life
To push me on
To something new
That I can hold on to
To keep me going on

[Verse 2]
Getting on a new high (Oh)
One that I met the other day
Not much of a high
Not much of a day (Sha-bi-du-da-day)
How about nostalgia
Remembеring how it was before
When I could feel, now I can't feel no morе

[Pre-Chorus]
The phone is ringing
But there's no one on the line
I need a guiding light to come to me
And show me (Show me)
Where to go (Where to go)

[Chorus]
I need a new thing in my life
To get me through
All the ups and downs
Turn me around
A new thing in my life
To push me on
To something new
That I can hold on to
To keep me going on

[Chorus]
A new thing in my life
To get me through
All the ups and downs
Turn me around
A new thing in my life
To push me on
To something new
That I can hold on to (Oh)
A new thing in my life
To get me through
All the ups and downs
Turn me around
A new thing in my life
To push me on
To something new
That I can hold on to
