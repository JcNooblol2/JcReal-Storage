Song Title: just how i imagined you
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
The silence was so loud
We couldn't hear a sound
So you kissed me on the mouth
And you took away my doubts
You could say our tongues were tied
When we tried to say goodbye
And all it took was absolutely nothing more than you, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I would never let go
Wouldn't wanna miss out
I would never discount a second that I had with you
From the moment I saw you holding that guitar
I knew the way that you are is just how I imagined you

[Verse 2]
Far from the days where I wondered what it was like to be loved
Wrote down on paper the kind of person I hoped would show up
Knowing you lie about your height, that we would be getting along
Along

[Chorus]
I would never let go
Wouldn't wanna miss out
I would never discount a second that I had with you
From the moment I saw you holding that guitar
I knew the way that you are is just how I imagined you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, stop your playing
I'm not playing
Wish you could see (Wish you could see)
Precious time is wasted
It's not okay when you're not with me (You're not with me)

[Bridge]
Baby, stop your playing
I'm not playing
Wish you could see
Precious time is wasted
It's not okay when you're not with me

[Chorus]
I would never let go
Wouldn't wanna miss out
I would never discount a second that I had with you
From the moment I saw you holding that guitar
I knew the way that you are is just how I imagined you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, stop your playing
I'm not playing
Wish you could see (Wish you could see)
Precious time is wasted
It's not okay when you're not with me (You're not with me)

[Outro]
(Wish you could see)
