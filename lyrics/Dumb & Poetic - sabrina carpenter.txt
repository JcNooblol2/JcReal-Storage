Song Title: Dumb & Poetic
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
And "love everyone" is your favorite quotation
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen

[Chorus]
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man

[Verse 2]
You're so sad there's no communication
But, baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish

[Chorus]
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man
