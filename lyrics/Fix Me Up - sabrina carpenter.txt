Song Title: Fix Me Up
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus, Both]
Tell me something you never told before
Before I walk through the door, I adore you, I adore you
I do
I do
Smile with me and cry with me
I won't ever tell a soul
Hold my hand, I'll squeeze it back
And I'll never let go

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus, Both]
Never give up, never look back
I won't give up, I'll keep on trying
Dry your tears up, all your crying
Cannot fix me up, my darling
Fix me up, my darling

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus, Both]
Twisty, turn-y, winding path
I could listen to your laugh
As I tiptoe down these humble truths
I don't wanna lose you
Show me how to love deeper than the surface, my friеnd
And you can show me what it means to have purposе
And I'll tell you again

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus, Both]
Never give up, never look back
I won't give up, I'll keep on trying
Dry your tears up, all your crying
Cannot fix me up, my darling
Fix me up, my darling

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus]
Hold on
Don't you lose hope, the sky's not falling
Please just listen 'cause I'll be calling
Stay with me just one more moment
I know you're in pain, just please don't show it
One more moment, please
It's too late, I'm afraid I have to leave
One more moment, please
It's too late, I'm afraid I have to leave
One more moment, please
It's too late, I'm afraid I have to leave
One more moment, please
It's too late, I'm afraid I have to leave
Just promise me, promise me that you'll

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Fin Argus, Both]
Never give up, never look back
I won't give up, I'll keep on trying
Dry your tears up, all your crying
Cannot fix me up, my darling
Fix me up, my darling
Fix me up, my darling
Fix me up, my darling
