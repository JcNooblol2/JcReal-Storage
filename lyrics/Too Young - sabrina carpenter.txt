Song Title: Too Young
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Big lights
People rushing to grow up, before you know
Stop signs
Denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Verse 2]
Rain drops
Deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing
Running to a place where nobody says "no"

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah

[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Interlude]
'Cause I'm not too young, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And if I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
And if I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
'Cause I'm not too young
