Song Title: Lady Monroe
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
The people are talkin'
Say I need to listen
I’m losing my marbles
Don't know what I'm doin’
I've heard of this feelin'
It's in every movie and every poem that I have been readin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this the feelin' of love?
'Cause it's a feelin’ I love
Nothin’ that I've ever known
But I really wanna know what you know
Is this the feelin’ of love?
'Cause it's a feelin' I love
Nothin’ that I've ever known
But I really wanna know what you know

[Chorus]
All I know is everythin' goes slower
When you look at me like I'm Lady Monroe
The way my fingertips fall in your hand
Bеneath the chandeliеr is all I need to know

[Verse 2]
So don't make my body
No don't leave me hanging
Like my favorite series
Of "What's gonna happen?"
It's almost like music
But you never see it
The power of side
I will force you to feel it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this the feelin' of love?
'Cause it's a feelin' I love
Nothin' that I've ever known
But I really wanna know what you know
Is this the feelin' of love?
'Cause it's a feelin' I love
Nothin' that I've ever known
But I really wanna know what you know

[Chorus]
All I know is everythin' goes slower
When you look at me like I'm Lady Monroe
The way my fingertips fall in your hand
Beneath the chandelier is all I need to know

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this the feelin' of love? (Oh)
'Cause it's a feelin' I love (Oh)
Nothin' that I've ever known (Oh)
But I really wanna know what you know
Is this the feelin' of love? (Oh)
'Cause it's a feelin' I love (Oh)
Nothin' that I've ever known (Oh)
But I really wanna know what you know

[Chorus]
All I know is everythin' goes slower
When you look at me like I'm Lady Monroe
The way my fingertips fall in your hand
Beneath the chandelier is all I need to know
All I know is everythin' goes slower
When you look at me like I'm Lady Monroe
The way my fingertips fall in your hand
Beneath the chandelier is all I need to know
