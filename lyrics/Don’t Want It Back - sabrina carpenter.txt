Song Title: Donâ€™t Want It Back
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Baby, you're home

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're livin' for tonight...

[Chorus]
You give me a reason to feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back

[Verse 2]
This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time, no
We're livin' for tonight

[Chorus]
You give me a reason (Ooh, no) to feel what I feel (No, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears (No, no)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart, I don't want it back

[Bridge]
You give me a reason (Huh)
You give me a feeling (Uh-huh-a)
But all of the things you've given to me
You've given to me, baby...

[Outro]
You give me a reason to (No, no) feel what I feel
When everything is under attack (Oh, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer (Oh no, no) to all of my fears (Oh)
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Don't want it back, no, baby
You got my heart, I don't want it back
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
You got my heart, I don't want it back
