Song Title: Space
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Under pressure (Pressure)
Questions all around, but there's no answers (Answers)
Try to keep my pace, they want it faster (Faster)
Records all around, they give me shelter, shelter (Shelter, shelter)

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough
(It's never enough)

[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me

[Refrain]
So gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space
Just gimme a little, gimme a little (More)

[Verse 2]
Satisfaction (Satisfaction)
All we ever want, but I can't have it (Have it)
Scribbles on the page, they call it magic (Magic)
Makes me wanna be what you imagine, imagine

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to hurry (No need to hurry)
No need to rush (No need to rush)
I tell them my story, it's never enough
(It's never enough)

[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me

[Post-Chorus]
(When the eyes are all around)
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
(Keep it low, don't make a sound)
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
(When the eyes are all around)
Gimme, gimme, gimme space (Space)
(Keep it low, don't make a sound)
Gimme, gimme, gimme space
Space

[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
(Gimme some room to breathe)
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
(Oh no, no)

[Post-Chorus]
(When the eyes are all around)
I'm hiding from my shadows
(Gimme, gimme, gimme space)
(Keep it low, don't make a sound)
I know that you are watching
(Gimme, gimme, gimme space)
(When the eyes are all around)
I need a taste of freedom
(Gimme, gimme, gimme space)
Gimme some room to breathe
(Keep it low, don't make a sound)
I know that you are watching
(Gimme, gimme, gimme space)
You're right there watching me

[Outro]
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space)
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space)
Just give me some space
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little, a little more space)
Just give me some space
(A little more)
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little)
Just give me some space, baby
