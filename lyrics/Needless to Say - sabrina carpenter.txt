Song Title: Needless to Say
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Guess you think it's kinda funny
All the boys who love-and-left me
In New York now, getting laid
Guess you think it's entertaining
Early-twenties judgment
Oh, it gets you off, how much you love it

[Chorus]
You need
Need less to say about everything
Need more to do than just focus on me
Try working on you
I promise you'll be much happier if you do

[Verse 2]
A pretty dress, an awkward angle
I bet you zoomed in close and held it up to show all of your friends
So much spite, I bet it's painful
One-way conversations
How's the weather in your mother's basement?

[Chorus]
You need
Need less to say about еverything
Need more to do than just focus on me
Try working on you
I promisе you'll be much happier if you do
You need
Need lessons on immaturity
Need more to do than just comment at me
Try working on you
I promise you'll be much happier if you do (Ooh)

[Outro]
You do
Needless to say
Needless to say
Needless to say
