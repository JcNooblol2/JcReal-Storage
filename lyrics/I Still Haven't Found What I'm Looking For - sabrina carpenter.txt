Song Title: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 2: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
Just burning desire

I have spoken with the tongue of angels
I have held hands with the devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

[Chorus: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
No I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Bridge: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
He will lift you higher and higher
He will lift you up when you fall
He will be your shelter from a storm

[Verse 3: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter]
I believe in kingdom come
When all the colors bleed into one
Bleed into one
Yes, I'm still running

You broke the bounds, and loose the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believed it

[Chorus: Peter Hollens & Sabrina Carpenter, Peter, Sabrina]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for (Yes I still haven't found, mmm)
