Song Title: Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, your troubles will be out of sight
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Hey

[Verse 3]
And here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
And faithful friends who are dear to us
Will they gather near to us once more?
Oh, hoo

[Verse 4]
And through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
But 'til then, we'll have to muddle through somehow, no
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Bridge]
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh yeah

[Verse 5]
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will they gather near to us once more?
Now, and through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
But 'til then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
