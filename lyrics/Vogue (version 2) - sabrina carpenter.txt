Song Title: Vogue (version 2)
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Lights, pose
Flash, vogue
Head, toes
I drip gold

[Verse 1]
Never been as happy as the day I met you
Never been as healthy as the day you left
I thank God we never got those matching tattoos
But I've got other ways to make sure you don't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Said you needed somethin' to lean on
And sadly that it couldn't be me
Must've needed somethin' to sleep on
You can catch me in your dreams
Ha-ha

[Chorus]
I wanna be in Vogue
Cover of every issue
I want the kind of fame
Where you have to stare at my face in pictures
I wanna be in Vogue
Not for the money either
Just so you feel the pain
When you turn the page
While I'm every issue

[Verse 2]
Say it like a premonition
I can make you wait in lines for me
There won't be no competition baby
I'm the best you've ever seen

[Pre-Chorus]
Said you needed somethin' to lean on (On)
And sadly that it couldn't be me (Me)
You must've needed somethin' to sleep on
So catch me in your dreams

[Chorus]
I wanna be in Vogue
Cover of every issue
I want the kind of fame
Where you have to stare at my face in pictures
I wanna be in Vogue
Not for the money either (Either)
Just so you feel the pain
When you turn the page
While I'm every issue

[Post-Chorus]
Gonna wish you didn't go, baby
Wish you didn't go
Gonna wish you didn't go, baby
When I'm in Vogue

[Bridge]
Lights, pose
Flash, vogue
Head, toes
I drip gold
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Drip gold)
Lights (Lights)
Pose (Pose)
Flash (Flash)
Vogue (Vogue)
Head (Head)
Toes (Toes)
I drip (Drip) gold (Gold)
I wanna be in Vogue
On the september issue
Oh, mhm

[Chorus]
I wanna be in Vogue
Cover of every issue
I want the kind of fame
Where you have to stare at my face in pictures
I wanna be in Vogue
Not for the money either (Not for the money)
Just so you feel the pain
When you turn the page
While I'm every issue

[Post-Chorus]
Gonna wish you didn't go (Wish you didn't go) (Lights, pose)
Wish you didn't go (Head, toes)
Gonna wish you didn't go, baby (I drip gold)
When I'm in Vogue (When I'm in Vogue)
Gonna wish you didn't go, baby (Oh, wish you didn't go) (Lights, pose)
Wish you didn't go (Wish you didn't) (Head, toes)
Gonna wish you didn't go, baby (I drip gold)
When I'm in Vogue
