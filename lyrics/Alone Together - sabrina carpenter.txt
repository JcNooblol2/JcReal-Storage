Song Title: Alone Together
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Verse 1]
Oh, I could really like it
Maybe we could carve it in the woods
Oh, Florence in the spring time
Love me in the meantime, wish you would

[Pre-Chorus]
But if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too

[Chorus]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Verse 2]
Oh, strangers in the nighttime
There's never a right time to say "Hello"
Yeah, everyone's your best friend 'til you get to know them
But I know you

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too

[Chorus]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Outro]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone
We could be alone
We could be alone together
