Song Title: experimental
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Are your lights on? Yeah, I wonder
Is your night long? Could it be longer?
Is your drink strong? Could it be stronger?
Set it down when I arrive
'Cause you need both hands tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing right in front of me
We got more future than history
And my mind can't help but make believe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
We could be going places, we could be testin' patience
Oh, oh, oh, I'm feelin' experimental, baby
Take me to where your place is
Touch me in all locations
Oh, oh, we can get experimental, baby
Oh-oh, la-la-la, ah, we can get experimental

[Verse 2]
In the backseat, in the valley
Lights on, 'cause you love looking at me
And leave the door open like you're Bruno
Can't breathe, face down in the pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, when you're standing right in front of me
We got more future than history
And my mind can't help but make believe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
We could be going places, we could be testin' patience
Oh, oh, oh, I'm feelin' experimental, baby
Take me to where your place is
Touch me in all locations
Oh, oh, we can get experimental, baby
Oh-oh, la-la-la, ah, we can get experimental

[Outro]
La-la-la, ah, we can get experimental
