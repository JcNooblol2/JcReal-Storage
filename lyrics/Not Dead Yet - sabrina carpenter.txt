Song Title: Not Dead Yet
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet

[Verse 1]
So I'm not the one
Tell, you're telling me that it was fun
Left me with the kitchen faucet on
But now we're done, done, done, oh, yeah
You said to me, that we weren't meant to be
Dropping every bomb so casually
But now we're done, done, done, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Had me going, left me broken
No emotion, I-I-I-I

[Chorus]
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I couldn't breathе without you
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I'd be cold and gonе by now
That I'd be six feet underground
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet

[Verse 2]
So you couldn't stay
Guess I'll have to die another day
Find another dime with a bouquet
'Cause now we're done, done, done, oh
And since you let me go
I've been, I've been dancing on my own
I don't need this double bed no more
We're so done, done, done, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Had me going, left me broken
No emotion, I-I-I-I

[Chorus]
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I couldn't breathe without you
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I'd be cold and gone by now
That I'd be six feet underground
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, (Ah, no) ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
But I'm not dead yet

[Bridge]
So I guess, so I guess, so I guess I'm done
Thinking about you, not thinking about me
No-no
So I guess, so I guess, so I guess I'm moving on
Not thinking about you, not thinking about me-e, aye

[Chorus]
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I couldn't breathe without you
But I'm still breathing
Thought I'd be cold and gone by now
I'd be six feet underground
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet
(Dead yet, yet, yeah, no)
Thought I couldn't live without you (No)
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I couldn't breathe without you
(Yeah, hey)
But I'm not dead yet
Thought I'd be cold and gone by now
That I'd be six feet underground
Thought I couldn't live without you
But I'm not dead yet

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah (I'm not, I'm not)
Ah-ah-ah (I'm not, I'm not)
But I'm not dead yet
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah (Na-na-na), ah-ah-ah (No)
But I'm not dead yet
