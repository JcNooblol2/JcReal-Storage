Song Title: Made for All
Artist: Bini

[Intro: Mikha, Aiah]
It's B-I-N-I, BINI!
With Maybelline
Are you ready for this?
Here we go!

[Verse 1: Stacey, Gwen]
Feelin' like you ain't got it
Like you don't belong
Like you don't belong, can't seem to fit in
Wanna hide, keep overthinkin'
Gotta have that confidence, girl
Get up and show the world
Mag-lipstick, kilay, fonda't mascara
Maaga man, handa nang rumampa

[Pre-Chorus: Colet]
Open your eyes
Believe that you can shine bright

[Chorus: All, Maloi, Jhoanna]
Oh! Made for you, made for me
Handa ka ba sa beauty reveal? (Made for all)
Made for you, made for me
Face the world, express how you feel

[Verse 2: Mikha]
Make for every color, race, shape, height, weight
No limit to your gender, waist and age
Every shade and hue, have the courage to be you
No space for hate, it's time to celebrate (Aye)

[Verse 3: Aiah, Sheena]
Maybe you're born with it (Aye)
Maybe it's Maybelline (Yeah)
Moreno o mestiza, Pinay beauty o chinita
Lahat tayo may sariling ganda

[Bridge: Jhoanna, Maloi]
Open your eyes
Let 'em sparkle shine bright
Ipagmalaki mo sa buong mundo
Ang ganda na iyong-iyo, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All, Colet, Sheena & Aiah]
Made for you, made for me
Handa ka ba sa beauty reveal? (Made for all)
Made for you, made for me
Face the world, express how you feel

[Outro: ]
'Wag magtago, ipagmalaki mo (Made for you, made for me)
Ang ganda na iyong-iyo (Made for all)
'Wag papatalo, beauty, i-flaunt mo
Bawat araw ay 'yong-iyo (Made for me)
Made for you, made for us
Made for all
