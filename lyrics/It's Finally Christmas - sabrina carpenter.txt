Song Title: It's Finally Christmas
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Frost on the bedroom window
Snow fallin' on the ground
The leaves are gone for winter
But I feel the love all around
And no matter what's underneath the tree
It's the time we share that means the most to me

[Chorus]
We've been waiting so long
To decorate the tree and sing holiday songs
And it's all around us
It's finally Christmas
We've been waiting all year
For mistletoe and good cheer
And now it's all around us
It's finally Christmas

Ohhh

[Verse 2]
Cozy by the fire
We've got nowhere to go
The lights are glowing amber
It feels so good to be home
And no matter what's underneath the tree
It's the time we share that means the most to me

[Chorus]
We've been waiting so long
To decorate the tree and sing holiday songs
It's all around us
It's finally Christmas
We've been waiting all year for mistletoe and good cheer
And now it's all around us (Yeah, yeah)
It's finally Christmas


[Bridge]
Woah
The slay bells are ringing
The carolers are singing
It's finally Christmas
So many reasons that it's my favorite season

[Chorus]
We've been waiting so long (So long)
To decorate the tree and sing holiday songs
It's all around us (Yeah, yeah)
It's finally Christmas (Ohhh)
We've been waiting all year for mistletoe and good cheer
And now it's all around us
It's finally Christmas

Ohhh
It's finally Christmas
