[Verse 1]
Look around and see the wave of the future
Coming right at you between your eyes
Can you see the light at the end of the tunnel?

[Pre-Chorus]

There's a new idea, and its time has come
And it calls for freedom for everyone

[Chorus]
Brothers and sisters, let's get it together

Because now is the time to shout it louder together
Tell them just who we are
(Ooh)
