Song Title: Before I Had Love
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Before I had
Before I had love
Before I had
Before I had love

[Verse 1]
Never heard a bird sing
Never let somebody call me baby
Never woke up in the morning with that hungry feeling
Would've said falling is weak
Wouldn't switch up my plans in a blink
Wouldn't catch me crying at the movies, no no

[Pre-Chorus]
No sky ever looked so blue
No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt this true, mmm

[Chorus]
Before I had love
Before I had love
Bеfore I had love
I had nothing
Beforе I had love

[Verse 2]
Why is it that
I would get on a plane
Just to go grab some dinner
And stare at your face
I just thought of it now
'Cause it's starting to rain
I remember the days
Where you'd do the same

[Pre-Chorus]
No sky ever looked so blue
No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt so true, mmm

[Chorus]
Before I had love
Before I had love
Before I had love
I had nothing
Before I had love
Before I had love
Before I had love
I had nothing
Before I had
Love

[Outro]
Before I had
Before I had love
