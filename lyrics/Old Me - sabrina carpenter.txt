[Intro]
She know she need no intro-

Old me woulda chased that boy
New me don't do that no more
Old me woulda let me cry
But new me, she don't bat an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
She know she need no introduction, na-na-na-na
She know, she know, she got that something, na-na-na-na
She know, she know, she on that
No looking back, head of the pack, know where she at, know that she bad, bad, bad, bad

[Chorus]
Old me, old me, meet the new me
Old me, old me, I'm so sorry
It's nothing personal but you're too hurtable
And you got to go (You got to go!)
You got to go (You got to go!)
Old me, old me, meet the new me
Old me, old me, I'm so sorry
It's nothing personal but you're too hurtable
And you got to go (You got to go!)
You got to go (You got to go!)

[Verse 2]
Old me woulda done it wrong (You know she woulda baby)
Let him and let him lead me on (Lead him, lead him, lead him, baby)
Old me let him have a taste
But new me, she don't play that way (She don't play)

[Pre-Chorus]
She know she need no introduction, na-na-na-na-na-na
