Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
(Hmm, mmm-mmm)

[Verse 1]
You can't have it, don't touch it
I'm no merchandise in (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't matter if you want it, there's no compromisin' (Hey!)
If I make you comfortable, you're not reading me (Oh-oh-oh)
Unfortunately, we can't always get what we see

[Chorus]
The way you're staring at me, I can tell you're into me (Oh-oh-oh)
The way you're movin' around me, I know you're hurt (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm so, so sorry, but my love is not your destiny (Oh-oh-oh)
You look like a fool, you should know you do
If you keep staring at me

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Why are you staring at me?
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Quit, keep staring at me

[Verse 2]
Well don't ya know anybody else in this place?
Or, or did you come spеcifically for this pretty face?
You think it's funny, but I'll be your biggеst mistake
If you get too close, then I'll make you remember my name

[Chorus]
The way you're staring at me, I can tell you're into me (Oh-oh-oh)
Can tell you're into me
The way you're movin' around me, I know you're hurt (Oh-oh-oh)
No, I know you're hurt
I'm so, so sorry, but my love is not your destiny (Oh-oh-oh)
You look like a fool, you should know you do
If you keep staring at me

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Why are you staring at me?
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Quit, keep staring at me

[Bridge]
So what do you see?
(I know you're hurt)
When you're staring at me
You look like a fool, you should know you do
If you keep staring at me

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh), no-no
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Why are you staring at me?
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na, why are you staring at me?
Quit, keep staring at me
