Song Title: Breakup Vacation
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
Ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah), mm

[Verse 1]
Hotels under different names
You stare while I pour champagne
Make love to avoid the pain
Say it's wild, but you're glad I came

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me like it's the last time
Say my name for the last time
Feel it all like the first time, oh-oh
We could turn on the TV
I'll put on something dreamy
Show you what you'll be missing (Ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Three more days with no complications
Acting like our hearts won't be breaking (Ah)
Nobody knows it but us
It's the end but we're living it up (Ah-ah)
Let's just call it a breakup vacation
We can see the mess that wе're makin' (Ah)
Nobody knows it but us
It's the end but wе're living it up (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
One more, and now I just want you more
I love when you call me yours
But now I just want you more, mm-mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'll want today
And I'll be questioning everything
What did I get on the getaway
Leaving with less than I came

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold me like it's the last time
Say my name for the last time
Feel it all like the first time, oh-oh
We could turn on the TV
I'll put on something dreamy
Show you what you'll be missing (Ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Three more days with no complications
Acting like our hearts won't be breaking (Ah)
Nobody knows it but us
It's the end but we're living it up (Ah-ah)
Let's just call it a breakup vacation
We can see the mess that we're makin' (Ah)
Nobody knows it but us
It's the end but we're living it up (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
One more, and now I just want you more
I love when you call me yours
But now I just want you more, mm-mm-mm
(What do I do if I just want you more? Oh)

[Outro]
Mm-mm-mm, mm
Wish you were my love
Wish we could go back
