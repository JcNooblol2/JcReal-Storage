Song Title: Sir
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Excuse me, sir
I'd like to have a conversation
Tell me 'bout the things that make you question everything
About who you were
Did it make you wanna change the station?
Did it make you think that no one's ever really listening?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I don't know myself much better
We could find shit out together
You just tell me where you wanna start

[Chorus]
For the first time, it feels simple
Like I don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
Whеn I was young
Young

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
I think about how I must have donе
Something right
Or maybe it's just good karma from
A past life
'Cause last night, I just feel like I had something on my side

[Chorus]
And for the first time, it feels simple
Like I don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
When I was young
Young

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know myself much better
We could find shit out together
You just tell me where you wanna start

[Chorus]
What if I told you it was simple
And you don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
When I was young
Young

[Outro: Sabrina & Finneas]
I have to do one fuck up every take?
I like that-
