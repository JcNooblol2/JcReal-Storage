Song Title: Fever Dream
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with you by my side
And your hair was a mess, but you kissed me and asked if I slept alright
We're havin' trouble leaving on time
You told me it just feels so right to be here again, with me again

[Chorus]
So tell me why I gotta live without you?
'Cause all I wanna do is be around you
In my arms, I could've sworn that you didn’t leave
It felt so real to me, just like a fever dream
Why does it feel so good to disregard reality?

[Verse 2]
With everything in me, I tried to leave it wherе we were that night
But how do wе meet in a whole other city like it's not a sign?
For moments, we're so fucking aligned
Two minutes later, might be the last time I see you again
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
So tell me why I gotta live without you?
'Cause all I wanna do is be around you
In my arms, I could've sworn that you didn't leave
It felt so real to me, just like a fever dream
Why does it feel so good to disregard reality?

[Outro]
Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby
I'll be your Lucy in the sky
Don't wake me up until you're mine
Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby
I'll be your Lucy in the sky
Don't wake me up until you're mine
Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby
I'll be your Lucy in the sky
Don't wake me up until you're mine
Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby
I'll be your Lucy in the sky
Don't wake me up until you're mine
