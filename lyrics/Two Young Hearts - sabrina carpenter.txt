Song Title: Two Young Hearts
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
It's a narrow line I'm walking
Better watch my step
'Cause we got everybody talking
And I can hear 'em say

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind (my mind)
And yes, I know what love is

[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts
They say we're too young

[Verse 2]
I could lie awake in darkness
Oh, just to dream of you
And you could lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe in another lifetime
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds
And yes, we know what love is

[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts, oh

[Bridge]
We're gonna keep on running
Running for all that we are
We want it all or nothing
We knew it right from the start
We are a part of something
Something as old as time, time, time

[Chorus]
'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls
With two young hearts
Two young hearts

[Outro]
You're never too young
