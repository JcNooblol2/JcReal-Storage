Song Title: After Tonight
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
After tonight
Will the love we've vowed still linger after tonight?
When the stars aren’t bright no more
When the scent of perfume is gone
And the morning sun shines on you
Like some harsh light

[Verse 2]
After tonight
Will tomorrow make this moment just another dream
Or just another fairy tale?
Then it's back to reality
When the knight in shining armor turns to pale
After tonight

[Chorus]
Together, let's hold back the hands of time
Together, lеt’s make this moment shine
Thеre's not gonna be a tomorrow
There's only gonna be right now
We're not gonna let this feeling go
I want you right now, baby, don't you know?
I don't care about tomorrow
So let's not hold back on what we're gonna do tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
After tonight
Will tomorrow make this moment just another dream
Or just another fairy tale?
Then it’s back to reality
When the knight in shining armor turns to pale
After tonight

[Chorus]
Together, let’s hold back the hands of time
Together, let's make this moment shine
There’s not gonna be a tomorrow
There's only gonna be right now
We're not gonna let this feeling go
I want you right now, baby, don't you know?
I don’t care about tomorrow
So let's not hold back on what we're gonna do tonight
So let's not hold back on what we're gonna do tonight
Together, let's hold back the hands of time
Together, let's make this moment shine
There's not gonna be a tomorrow
There's only gona be right now (Gonna be right now)
We're not gonna let this feeling go
I want you right now, baby, don't you know?
I don't care about tomorrow
So, let's not hold back on what we're gonna do tonight
Together, let's hold back the hands of time
Together, let's make this moment shine
There's not gonna be a tomorrow
There's only gonna be right now
We're not gonna let this feeling go
I want you right now, baby, don't you know? (I'll hold you, baby)
I don't care about tomorrow
So let's not hold back on what we're gonna do tonight

[Outro]
Together, let's hold back the hands of time
Together, let's make this moment shine
There's not gonna be a tomorrow
There's only gonna be right now (Gonna be right now)
We're not gonna let this feeling go
I want you right now, baby, don't you know?
