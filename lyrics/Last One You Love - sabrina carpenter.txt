Song Title: Last One You Love
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
She got you right at the beginning of the innocent years
You were starry-eyed and optimistic
Keeps me up at night I missed it
She got all the midnight conversations
Got her name tied onto every heartfelt song you've written
She got all the shit I didn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, maybe I'm a little afraid that you'll never fully be mine, fully be mine
Maybe I'm a little bit late, or maybe I'm right on time, hm

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last onе you love
The one you hold a littlе tighter 'cause the others never meant this much, oh
I wanna be the last one you love
When you're talkin' 'bout forever doesn't matter who the first one was

[Verse 2]
Does it sting a little bit when I think about
All the others girl that you were kissin', parade around? Uh-huh
Maybe it's okay, come to think of it
They can have the memories, I'm living it

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm ahead of myself thinkin' what our kids will look like, look like
Maybe I'm a little bit late, or maybe I'm right on ti-i-i-ime

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last one you love
The one you hold a little tighter 'cause the others never meant this much, oh
I wanna be the last one you love
When you're talkin' 'bout forever doesn't matter who the first one was

[Outro]
The last one, wanna be the last one
Wanna be the last one, mm-mm
Wanna be the last one
Wanna be the last one, honey
I know you loved a couple others
But the truth is, baby, I'm more fun
Wanna be the last one
The last one
Wanna be the last one
