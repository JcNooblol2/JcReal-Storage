Song Title: Eyes Wide Open
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Intro]
La-di-da-da-da-na
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

[Verse 2]
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open (No)
Bless this ground, unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open (Yeah)

[Bridge]
All I have is just this moment
I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, in an instant

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open (Open)
Bless this ground, unbroken (Yeah)
I'm about to make my way (Make my way)
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

[Outro]
(Keep my eyes wide open)
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
(Keep my eyes wide open)
And my eyes wide open
I keep my eyes wide open
