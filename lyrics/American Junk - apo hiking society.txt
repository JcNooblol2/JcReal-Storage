Song Title: American Junk
Artist: apo hiking society

[Verse 1]
Leave me alone to my third world devices
I don't need your technology
You just want my natural resources
And then you leave me poor and in misery
Third world blues is what I got
Trouble, yes I got a lot

[Chorus]
(American Junk)
Get it out of my bloodstream
(American Junk)
Get it out of my system
(American Junk)
I can only take so much
(American Junk)
Gotta get back to who I am

[Skit]
Oh, hi there fella
Uy
Hey, what's your name?
Pedro
Oh, Pedro
No, no, Pedro
Yes  Pedro
No, Pedro
Pangalan ko na nga 'yan babaguhin mo pa

[Verse 2]
You call it new music
I call it pollution
Your music I now see on my television (American Top 40)
Why is it now I can only sing (A da da da, a da da da)
In English language that you people bring
Why is it now that they only play
Top 40 music on TV and radio

[Chorus]
(American Junk)
Get it out of my bloodstream
(American Junk)
Get it out of my system
(American Junk)
I can only take so much
(American Junk)
Gotta get back to who I am

[Skit]
Ok Pedro, listen to me
Repeat after me, say "Apple"
"Apple"
"Apple"
No, "Apple"
No no Pedro, it's "Apple"
"Apple" mansanas, pareho lang 'yan
Kinakain 'yan, inchendes?

[Chorus]
(American Junk)
Get it out of my bloodstream
(American Junk)
Get it out of my system
(American Junk)
I can only take so much
(American Junk)
Gotta get back to who I am

[Post-Chorus]
It's been so long since I had
A glance of what I think I really am

[Chorus]
(American Junk)
Get it out of my bloodstream
(American Junk)
Get it out of my system
(American Junk)
I can only take so much
(American Junk)
Gotta get back to who I am

[Skit]
