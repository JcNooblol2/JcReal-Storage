Song Title: Right Now
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
We'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never see the world like we do right now
So take in what's around you
Put your camera down
Take a shot
Give it all you got
I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward
Always looking back
They seem so near
But they're not here

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath

[Chorus]
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now

[Verse 2]
Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
When your love is so excited?
'Cause it's getting real
Have you stopped to listen
To what's in your soul?
That's your intuition
And it always knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath

[Chorus]
And slow down, slow down
My mind is racing
Catch up, catch up
I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wondering
But I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (let go)
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (begin)
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now

[Breakdown]
Oh, right now (Right now)
Right now (Right now)
Enjoy the ride
The ride that you're on
Right now
Right now
Yeah

[Outro]
Let go, let go
We hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin
To live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last
Right now
