Song Title: Blueberries
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Dandelions are going to seed
It's my soul I need to feed
Trees stand so tall and bare
And here I stand without a care

[Verse 2]
Pumpkin seeds stuck in my teeth
There's something more I need to be
More than just a silly girl
Waiting for the sun to hurl

[Chorus]
Rays of sunlight
Down the sidewalk, down on me
Casting light on
The turning leaves and what I'm supposed to see

[Verse 3]
Winter's here and settled in
But where are you? I can't begin
To imagine where I went wrong
Perhaps it was when I started this song

[Chorus]
Rays of sunlight
Reflecting off the snowflakes
There are no more crinkly leaves
I need to rake

[Post-Chorus]
There's a chance
A chance I need to take

[Verse 4]
Birds and bees are here again
We haven't talked since God knows when
I like to dance in the sprouting grass
If it snows again, then I'll have to ask

[Verse 5]
Why the hell are
The seasons fickle just like you?
Rip my heart in half
I'll stitch it up if it's certain we are through

[Verse 6]
Junebugs, butterflies, sand in my pants
Midnight moon and those pesky little ants
You're here once more to try your luck
Well, I'm done with you, you sneaky little

[Outro]
Now it's over
There's nothing left for us to do
Besides acknowledging the repelling forces
That are me and you
