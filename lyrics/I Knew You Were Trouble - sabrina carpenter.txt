Song Title: I Knew You Were Trouble
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd nеver been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you wеre trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
And now I'm lyin' on the cold, hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
(Oh)

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know he's the reason why
You're drowning, drowning, drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold, hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble
(Trouble, trouble, trouble)

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, no

[Pre-Chorus]
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble, oh, no
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
So shame on me
Flew me to places I'd never been (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
'Til you put me down, oh

[Outro]
I knew, I knew
I knew, baby, I knew (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
I knew, I knew
I knew, baby, I knew
