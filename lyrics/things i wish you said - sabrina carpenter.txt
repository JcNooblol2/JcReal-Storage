Song Title: things i wish you said
Artist: sabrina carpenter

[Verse 1]
"Baby, sorry I left you in the dark"
"I always reach for your leg over there on your side of the car"
"Baby, everything reminds me of you"
"Nobody gets my jokes, everyone here thinks I'm fuckin' rude"

[Chorus]
"When I saw you cry, I didn't handle it well"
"Without you here, I don't know what to do with myself"
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me

[Verse 2]
Things like, "Darlin', I hope you know it scared me to death
The night that your sister said that you got in an accident"
"And God, I, I'm watchin' everything that you do"
"I can't get your songs out of my head or your hair out of my room"

[Chorus]
"I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell
That I can't even stomach lovin' somebody else"
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
"Sorry that I pulled the 'it's not you, it's me'"
"One day, I'll make sure you get a real apology"
I waste my time, I waste my life on idiotic things
Like things you never said
Things you'll never say to me
